.Sh NAME
.Nm drbd-reactor.promoter
.Nd drbd-reactor promoter plugin
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm
is the promoter plugin for
.Xr drbd-reactor 1 .
.Pp
The promoter plugin monitors events on resources an executes systemd units.
This plugin can be used for simple high-availability.
.Pp
By default the plugin generates a series of systemd service overrides (i.e.,
what systemd calls
.Qq Drop-In )
and a systemd target unit that contains dependencies on these generated
services.  The services, and their order, is defined via the list specified in
.Sy start .
.Pp
The plugin generates two implicit extra units:
.Bl -bullet -compact
.It
a
.Sy drbd-promote@
override that promotes the DRBD resource (i.e., switches it to Primary). This
is a dependency for all the other units from
.Sy start
(according overrides are generated).
.It
a
.Sy drbd-resource@
target that subsumes all the generated dependencies from the
.Sy start
list.
.El
.Pp
Let's look at a simple example to see which overrides get generated from a
dummy start list like this:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
[[promoter]]
[promoter.resources.foo]
start = [ "a.service", "b.service", "c.service" ]
.Ed
.Pp
.Bl -bullet -compact
.It
.Pa /var/run/systemd/system/drbd-promote@foo.d/reactor.conf
containing the necessary pieces to wait for the backing devices of DRBD
resource
.Dq foo
and to promote it to Primary.
.It
.Pa /var/run/systemd/system/a.service.d/reactor.conf
containing a dependency on
.Sy drbd-promote@foo
.It
.Pa /var/run/systemd/system/b.service.d/reactor.conf
containing dependencies on
.Sy drbd-promote@foo
and on
.Sy a.service .
.It
.Pa /var/run/systemd/system/c.service.d/reactor.conf
containing dependencies on
.Sy drbd-promote@foo
and on
.Sy b.service .
.It
.Pa /var/run/systemd/system/drbd-resource@foo.target.d/reactor.conf
containing dependencies on
.Sy a.service ,
.Sy b.service ,
and
.Sy c.service .
.El
.Pp
If a DRBD resource changes its state to
.Dq may promote ,
the plugin (i.e., all plugins on all nodes in the cluster)
start the generated systemd target (e.g.,
.Sy drbd-resource@foo.target
). All will try to start the
.Sy drbd-promote@
unit first, but only one will succeed and continue to start the rest of the
services. All the others will fail intentionally.
.Pp
In order to promote the resource with the best disk state, the plugin
evaluates its local disk states and waits a short period of time, which might
give a promoter on another host the chance (i.e., because its sleep time is
shorter) to promote the resource first. Sleep times are calculated as follows:
.TS
allbox tab(:);
r r .
DiskState:Sleep time in seconds
Diskless:6
Attaching:6
Detaching:6
Failed:6
Negotiating:6
Unknown:6
Inconsistent:3
Outdated:2
Consistent:1
UpToDate:0
.TE
.Pp
The actual sleep time is calculated as the worst case of all the volumes in a
resource and can be scaled by setting
.Sy sleep-before-promote-factor .
.Pp
If a resource loses
.Dq quorum ,
it stops the systemd
.Sy drbd-services@
target and all the dependencies.
Stopping services on the node that lost quorum is the standard behavior one
would expect from a cluster manger. There might be scenarios where it is
preferable to freeze the started service until quorum is gained again. As this
requires multiple prerequisites to hold true, freezing a resource on quorum
loss is described in
.Sx FREEZING RESOURCES .
.Pp
The plugin's configuration can contain an action that is executed if a stop
action fails (e.g., triggering a reboot). Start actions in
.Sy start
are
interpreted as 
.Xr systemd.unit 5 .
and have to have an according postfix like 
.Sy .service
or
.Sy .mount .
.Sy ocf
resource agents are supported via the
.Sy ocf.ra@
service. Please see
.Sx OCF RESOURCE AGENTS
for a detailed overview.
.Pp
The configuration can contain a setting that specifies that resources are
stopped whenever the plugin exits (e.g., on service restart).
.Pp
It also contains a
.Sy runner
that can be set to
.Sy shell .
Then the items in
.Sy start
are interpreted as shell scripts and started in order (no explicit targets or
anything) and stopped in reverse order or as defined via
.Sy stop .
This can be used on systems without systemd and might be useful for Windows
systems in the future. If you can, use the default systemd method, it is the
preferred one.
.Pp
In order for DRBD to use quorum as needed by this plugin, make sure the
resource file of the DRBD resource contains the following option (this is the
default for LINSTOR, but your resources needs to qualify for quorum).
.Bd -literal -offset indent
options {
   auto-promote no;
   quorum majority;
   on-suspended-primary-outdated force-secondary;
   on-no-quorum io-error; # for the default drbd-reactor on-quorum-loss policy (i.e., Shutdown)
   # on-no-quorum suspend-io; # for freezing resources
   on-no-data-accessible io-error # always set this to the value of on-no-quorum!
   # on-no-data-accessible suspend-io # for freezing, always set this to the value of on-no-quorum!
}
# net { rr-conflict retry-connect; } # for freezing resources
.Ed
.Sy drbd-reactor
itself is pretty relaxed about these settings, don't expect too much hand
holding or even auto-configuration, you as the admin are the one that should
understand your system, but it checks properties and writes warnings to the
log (file/journal) if misconfiguration is detected.
.Sh SERVICE DEPENDENCIES
Let's get back to our simple example:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
[[promoter]]
[promoter.resources.foo]
start = [ "a.service", "b.service", "c.service" ]
.Ed
.Pp
As we noted in previously we generate a dependency chain for these services
(i.e., all depend on
.Sy drbd-promote@
as well as on the previous services). The strictness of these dependencies can
be set via
.Sy dependencies-as
, where the default is
.Sy Requires
.Xr systemd.unit 5
.Pp
We also generate the mentioned
.Sy drbd-services@.target
, which lists all the services from
.Sy start .
The dependencies for that are generated via the value set in
.Sy target-as .
.Pp
Especially when one debugs services it might make sense to lower these
defaults to for example
.Sy Wants .
Otherwise a failed service might prohibit a successful start of the
.Sy drbd-services@.target
, which then triggers a stop of the target and its dependencies, which might
again trigger a start because the resource is DRBD promotable again and so on.
.Pp
It is really up to you and how strict/hard you want your dependencies and what
their outcome should be.
.Sy Requires
should be a good default, you might lower or increase the strictness
depending on the scenario.
.Sh OCF RESOURCE AGENTS
It is possible to use
.Lk https://github.com/ClusterLabs/resource-agents "resource agents"
in the
.Sy start
list of
services via
.Sy ocf:$vendor:$agent instance-id name=value ...
The
.Sy instance-id
is user defined and gets
postfixed with
.Sy _$resourcename .
For example the generated systemd unit for an
.Sy instance-id
of
.Dq p_iscsi_demo1
for a DRBD resource
.Dq foo
would be
.Sy ocf.ra@p_iscsi_demo1_foo .
.Sy name
/
.Sy value
pairs are passed
to the unit as environment variables prefixed with
.Sy OCF_RESKEY_ .
In a concrete example using the
.Dq heartbeat:IPaddr2
agent this could look like this:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
start = [
  "foo.service",
  "ocf:heartbeat:IPaddr2 p_iscsi_demo1_ip ip=10.43.7.223 cidr_netmask=16",
  "bar.service"
]
.Ed
.Sh FREEZING RESOURCES
The default behavior when a DRBD Primary loses quorum is to immediately stop
the generated target unit and hope that other nodes still having quorum will
successfully start the service. This works well if services can be failed
over/started on another node in reasonable time. Unfortunately there are
services that take a very long time to start, for example huge data bases.
.Pp
When a DRBD Primary loses its quorum we basically have two possibilities:
.Bl -bullet -compact
.It
the rest of the nodes, or at least parts of it still have quorum: Then these
have to start the service, they are the only ones with quorum, but still we
could keep the old Primary in a frozen state. And then, when the nodes with
quorum come into contact with the old Primary, then it should stop the service
and its storage should become in sync with the other nodes.
.It
the rest of the nodes are not able to form a partition with quorum. In such a
scenario there are no alternatives anyways, we would need to keep the Primary
frozen. But if the nodes eventually join the old Primary again, and quorum
would be restored, we could just unfreeze/thaw the old Primary (which is also
the new Primary).
.El
.Pp
There are several requirements for this to work properly:
.Bl -bullet -compact
.It
A system with unified cgroups. If the file
.Pa /sys/fs/cgroup/cgroup.controllers
exists you should be fine. That requires a relatively
.Dq new
kernel. Note that
.Dq even
RHEL8 for example needs the addition of
.Sy systemd.unified_cgroup_hierarchy
on the kernel command line.
.It
a service that can tolerate to be frozen
.It
DRBD option
.Sy on-suspended-primary-outdated
set to
.Sy force-secondary
.It
DRBD option
.Sy on-no-quorum
set to
.Sy suspend-io
.It
DRBD option
.Sy on-no-data-accessible
set to
.Sy suspend-io
.It
DRBD net option
.Sy rr-conflict
set to
.Sy retry-connect
.El
If these requirements are fulfilled, then one can set the promoter option
.Sy on-quorum-loss
to
.Sy freeze .
.Sh PREFERRED NODES
While in a HA cluster that deserves the name every node needs to be able to
run all services, some users like to add preferences for nodes. This can be
done by setting a list of 
.Sy preferred-nodes .
On resource startup a delay based on the node's position in the list is added.
Nodes with a lower preference will sleep longer. If a node joins on DRBD
level, and that peer's disk becomes
.Sy UpToDate ,
and the peer has a higher preference, then the active node stops the services
locally. As it will then have a higher sleep penalty as the preferred node,
the preferred one will take over the service (if it can).

.Sh EXAMPLES
This configures a promoter for resource
.Dq foo .
If the resource might be promoted the
.Dq foo.mount
and
.Dq foo.service
units get started. On DRBD demote failures a systemd "reboot" is triggered.
.Bd -literal -offset indent
[promoter.resources.foo]
start = ["foo.mount", "foo.service"]
on-drbd-demote-failure =  "reboot"
stop-services-on-exit = false
preferred-nodes = ["nodeA", "nodeB" ]
